Hi, I'm @321MBT (3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol)

I'm interested in computer, botanical, and engineering science. I plan to create a few projects, help with others, and fork one of my favorites for some personal tweaks.  

I'm working to increase to coding skills and breadth and I'm new to Git, so I'm excited to be here.

-Cheers!
